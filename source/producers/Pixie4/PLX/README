PLX driver installer for Linux
===============================================================================

Introduction:
To use Pixie-4 in Linux, you need to compile the PLX driver for your specific
kernel. Every time you update your kernel, you will need to rebuild the driver.
You will also need to make the system load it every time you boot up. To ease
the process, we have created the following script.

To install PLX driver for linux:
(1) Run "sudo ./install.sh"
(2) Reboot
(3) Run "./test.sh" to see if it loads correctly (optional)

Troubleshooting:
The script first attempts to build the debug version of the driver.
If the driver failes to load, please look at its debug output.

The following issue was encountered:
"Kernel VA: ERROR - Unable to map space to Kernel VA"
There might be a conflict with an already installed device.
In this case, try the following:
   a) Make sure a PLX device is visible via PCI bridge
      by running "lspci"
   b) See if the needed addresses are already claimed by a different
      driver by running "cat /proc/iomem"
      If so, take note of the kernel module name used and blacklist it
      by adding "blacklist net2272" into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
   c) try loading the PLX driver again


History:
The script was written at NIST 
to simplify updating the driver after kernel
updates. Tested on Ubuntu Xeon system. The load-plx9054 script was written 
on the basis of the Plx_load code provided by PLX.
